# WIA1002 (Data Structure)

[**WIA1002**](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/view.php?id=146) is a programming core course with the prerequisite of [**WIX1002**](https://github.com/LimJY03/WIX1002_UM) introduced to Year 1 students in the [**Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT)**](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my/) of [**Universiti Malaya (UM)**](https://www.um.edu.my/), Malaysia.

In this course, we will be learning data structures and algorithms using [**`Java`**](https://dev.java/learn/) language. There would be **at most 1** lab for each chapter in this course, and each lab would have some questions for students to try and solve using their coding skills.

This repository stores my solutions for tutorial and lab classes throughout this course.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains multiple lab folders, each indicating the lab number. The directory diagram below shows the structure in most folders:

```
Lab_##
 ├─ L#Q#.java
 ├─ L#Q#.java
 └─ L#Q#.java
```

> **Warning**
> <br>The diagram above is not applicable for certain folders.

The `Lab_##` parent folder refers to the lab number.

* `Lab_02` refers to the Lab #2 in this course.

The file `L#Q#.java` refers to a solution using `Java` for one question in the lab. There will be multiple numbers of `Java` file depending on the number of questions in the lab.

* `L1Q2.java` refers to the solution for Lab **1**, Question **2**.

> **Note**
> <br>The I/O files (if applicable) are included in the respective Lab Folder as well.

This repository also contains multiple tutorial folders, similar to lab folders, it also indicates the tutorial number. The directory diagram below shows the structure in most folders:

```
Tutorial_##
 ├─ src
 └─ README.md
```

> **Warning**
> <br>The diagram above is not applicable for certain folders.

Similar to the lab, the `Tutorial_##` parent folder refers to the lab number.

* `Tutorial_02` refers to the Tutorial Question #2 in this course.

The file `README.md` contains the question and solution for that tutorial using `Java`.

> **Note**
> <br>The `src` folder stores the relevant images that are rendered in the `README.md` file and it is not present in every tutorial parent folder.
